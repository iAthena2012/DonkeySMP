      <h2>Ongoing Projects</h2>
      <p>
        At DONKEY SMP, we pride ourselves on our community-driven projects. Our server members are continuously engaged in exciting builds and challenges that bring everyone together.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, we are working on a magnificent <strong>Castle</strong> that will serve as a central hub for all players. This grand structure will be a sight to behold and a place for events.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are also creating a <strong>Museum</strong> that will showcase rare items and artifacts collected throughout our adventures, allowing players to reminisce about their journeys.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the thrill-seekers, we have a project to <strong>Kill the Dragon</strong>, a challenging endeavor that requires teamwork and strategy.
      </p>
      <p>
        We aim to face the powerful <strong>Wither Warden</strong> in a cooperative boss battle, testing our strength and skills as a community.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lastly, a <strong>PVP Arena</strong> is under construction for those who enjoy competitive play. Gather your friends and engage in epic battles!
