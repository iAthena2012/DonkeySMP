      <p>
        At DONKEY SMP, we offer a variety of ranks that players can purchase to unlock exclusive perks and stand out in the community. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>Player</strong> rank is the default for all users, giving you access to the basic features of our server. As you progress, you can obtain the <strong>Moderator</strong> rank, which allows you to assist in managing server activities and help your fellow players.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're looking for more control, the <strong>Admin</strong> rank provides full administrative access to the server tools and features.
      </p>
      <p>
        For those who want to enjoy exclusive benefits, the <strong>VIP</strong> rank unlocks special areas and commands. The <strong>Elite VIP</strong> rank provides even more privileges, while the <strong>Legend</strong> rank offers the highest tier of access to unique features.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, the <strong>Seller</strong> rank allows you to participate in the in-game economy and sell items via auctions, providing further opportunities to earn and trade with other players.
